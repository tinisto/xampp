EMERGENCY ACTIVATION - SIMPLE UPLOAD GUIDE
==========================================

Since automatic FTP is failing, you need to manually upload ONE file.

STEP 1: Open FileZilla on your Mac
-----------------------------------
1. Open FileZilla application
2. Use Quick Connect bar at the top

STEP 2: Enter Connection Details
--------------------------------
Try these in order until one works:

OPTION A:
- Host: ftp.ipage.com
- Username: u2709849
- Password: [your current password]
- Port: 21

OPTION B:  
- Host: 11klassniki.ru
- Username: u2709849
- Password: [your current password]
- Port: 21

STEP 3: Upload the Emergency File
---------------------------------
1. LEFT PANEL (Local):
   Navigate to: /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/

2. Find this file:
   emergency_activation.php

3. RIGHT PANEL (Remote):
   Navigate to the root directory (/) or public_html/

4. DRAG the file from left to right panel

STEP 4: Activate Your Account
-----------------------------
1. Visit: https://11klassniki.ru/emergency_activation.php
2. Enter your email address
3. Click "Activate Account"
4. You should see a success message
5. Try logging in at: https://11klassniki.ru/login

STEP 5: Delete the File (IMPORTANT!)
------------------------------------
After activating your account:
1. In FileZilla, right-click emergency_activation.php on the remote side
2. Select "Delete"
3. Confirm deletion

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If you see 404 error:
1. Try: https://11klassniki.ru/public_html/emergency_activation.php
2. Check if file was uploaded to correct directory
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for server to update

If FileZilla won't connect:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify FTP credentials with iPage support
3. Try using "Site Manager" instead of Quick Connect
4. Enable "Passive mode" in Transfer Settings

ALTERNATIVE: Ask iPage Support
------------------------------
If you still can't upload:
1. Contact iPage support
2. Tell them: "I need to upload one PHP file to fix account activation"
3. They can help verify FTP credentials or upload for you
