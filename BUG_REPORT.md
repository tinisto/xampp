# Bug Report for 11klassniki.ru
**Date:** August 11, 2025

## üêõ Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Unknown column 't.town_name' error
**File:** `/pages/common/educational-institutions-in-region/educational-institutions-in-region.php`
**Issue:** Query was using wrong column names for towns table
- Changed `t.id_town` to `t.town_id` (line 214, 216, 218)
- Changed `t.$region_id_column` to `t.region_id` (line 217)
**Status:** Fixed

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING: mysqli object already closed error
**File:** `/common-components/header.php` (line 413 in error log)
**Issue:** mysqli connection being used after it's closed
**Note:** Line numbers in error log don't match current file - may be old error or cached version

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR: Missing files referenced
**Files:**
- `config.php` - Referenced but missing
- `config/database_connection.php` - Referenced but missing  
- `check-spo-titles.php` - Referenced but missing
**Impact:** Low - these appear to be from old code or test files

## üìä System Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- Database connection (MySQL)
- All main page files have no syntax errors
- Include files are properly structured
- No obvious SQL injection vulnerabilities found

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings:
- Session handling warning in test script (headers already sent)
- Some missing referenced files
- Old error logs showing mysqli issues that may be resolved

## üîç Database Information
- **Database:** MySQL (not SQLite as some documentation suggested)
- **Towns table structure confirmed:**
  - Primary key: `town_id` (not `id_town`)
  - Has columns: `town_name`, `town_name_en`, `region_id`

## üìù Recommendations
1. Clear PHP error logs and monitor for new errors
2. Test the educational institutions pages to verify the fix
3. Check if mysqli closed errors still occur
4. Consider removing references to missing config files
5. Update documentation to clarify MySQL vs SQLite usage

# Check PHP syntax
php -l filename.php
