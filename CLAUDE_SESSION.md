## 🗃️ Database Schema Requirements

The comments system requires the following database modifications:

```sql
-- Add new columns for threaded comments
ALTER TABLE comments 
ADD COLUMN parent_id INT NULL AFTER entity_id,
ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER author_of_comment,
ADD COLUMN author_ip VARCHAR(45) NULL AFTER email,
ADD COLUMN likes INT DEFAULT 0 AFTER comment_text,
ADD COLUMN is_approved TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1 AFTER likes;

-- Add performance indexes
ALTER TABLE comments 
ADD INDEX idx_parent_id (parent_id),
ADD INDEX idx_entity_type_id (entity_type, entity_id),
ADD INDEX idx_date (date),
ADD INDEX idx_approved (is_approved);

-- Add referential integrity
ALTER TABLE comments 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_parent_comment 
FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```
