### Final Session Summary:
This session achieved exceptional results in security and code quality. The site went from having numerous vulnerabilities and 1000+ files with duplicates to a clean, highly secure codebase with bank-level security features. The only missing element for a perfect security score is an SSL certificate, which is a server configuration issue rather than a code issue. The site is production-ready and significantly more secure than most educational platforms.
