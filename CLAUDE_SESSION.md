### Phase 28: Site Version Discovery and First Commit Restoration

#### Initial Problem
- User continued from previous session, trying to find the correct site version
- Site had redirect loops and database connection issues
- User wanted the version with Categories in header and tests without header/footer

#### Key Discovery Process
1. **Multiple Site Versions Found**
   - Current main branch had complex template system
   - User wanted an older, simpler version
   - Found commits: 1b941e7, 4818011, and finally went back to first commit 09b4e14

2. **Redirect Loop Issues Fixed**
   - Problem: index.php → check_under_construction.php → maintenance.php → index.php
   - Solution: Created bypass for check_under_construction.php
   - Fixed .htaccess redirect rule causing loops

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Original code redirected to /error on connection failure
   - Created simplified db_connections.php without redirects
   - Added support for both password configurations (root with 'root' and without password)

#### First Commit (09b4e14) Restoration

**Original Layout Features:**
- Bootstrap dark navigation bar
- Database-driven categories in navigation
- "Рубрики" dropdown with categories from database
- "Новости" dropdown with news categories
- "Тесты" dropdown with IQ and aptitude tests
- Simple template-engine.php (not the complex ultimate version)
- Clean index_content.php showing posts

**Files Modified:**
1. `/database/db_connections.php` - Simplified connection with multiple password attempts
2. `/common-components/check_under_construction.php` - Bypass for local development
3. `/vendor/autoload.php` - Minimal autoload file
4. `/common-components/header.php` - Added null checks for database connection
5. `/index_content.php` - Added database connection checks with fallback messages

**Database Status:**
- Database: 11klassniki_ru
- Categories: 16 entries
- Posts: 538 entries
- News categories: Present
- Connection working with automatic password detection

#### Current Working State
- Site loads at http://localhost/
- Original first commit layout restored
- Categories load from database in navigation
- Posts display in "Недавние статьи" and "Абитуриентам" sections
- Graceful fallbacks if database unavailable
- No more redirect loops or 500 errors

#### Test System Status
- Found test-simple.php with full-screen test interface
- Tests run without header/footer as requested
- Located at /pages/tests/test-simple.php
- Accessible via routing or direct access

### Key Achievements
✅ Found and restored the original first commit layout
✅ Fixed all database connection issues
✅ Categories dropdown loads from database (not hardcoded)
✅ Site works at http://localhost/
✅ Tests available without header/footer
✅ No more redirect loops or errors

### Important Notes
- This is commit 09b4e14 (first commit) - the simplest, cleanest version
- Database connection tries both 'root' password and no password automatically
- All navigation dropdowns are database-driven
- Original Bootstrap dark theme preserved

### WORKING STATE SAVED
- **Branch Created**: `first-commit-working`
- **Pushed to GitHub**: Successfully saved this working state
- **Commit**: ff5e447 (detached HEAD state from first commit)
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY WORKING SITE - User confirmed they can see it
- **Date**: 2025-08-13

This represents a stable, working version of the site with:
- Original first commit layout
